## Chapter One: INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Background of the case study

University campus cafeterias serve as essential hubs for student and staff dining, often handling hundreds or even thousands of customers daily. The Campus Cafe, like many traditional university cafeterias, has been operating with conventional paper-based systems for menu display, order taking, and inventory management. This approach has increasingly proven to be inefficient in today's fast-paced digital environment.

As student populations grow and dietary preferences diversify, campus cafeterias face increasing pressure to modernize their operations. Digital transformation has become imperative to meet the expectations of tech-savvy students who are accustomed to convenience and efficiency in their digital interactions.

The Campus Cafe project emerged from the need to transition from traditional manual processes to a streamlined digital system that could handle menu management, order processing, and customer engagement more efficiently. By implementing a web-based solution, the cafe aims to enhance the dining experience while improving operational efficiency and data management.

### 1.2 Statement of the problem

## Chapter Two: LITERATURE REVIEW

### 2.0 Introduction

This chapter reviews existing literature related to web-based restaurant management systems, digital transformation in food service, and customer experience in university dining settings. The review aims to establish a theoretical foundation for the project, identify best practices, and understand the current state of technology adoption in campus food services.

### 2.1 To investigate into the existing literature in order to get what is required in developing a web-based restaurant menu

Research in digital food service solutions has evolved significantly over the past decade. Studies by Johnson & Smith (2018) indicate that digital menus increase average order values by 15-25% compared to traditional paper menus, primarily through better visual presentation and upselling opportunities.

Wilson (2020) found that 78% of college students prefer digital ordering options, with convenience and time-saving cited as primary motivations. This preference aligns with broader consumer trends identified by the National Restaurant Association (2021), which reports that 60% of restaurant orders for consumers under 30 are placed digitally.

Key requirements for effective web-based restaurant menus identified in the literature include:

1. **Visual Appeal**: High-quality images significantly influence purchasing decisions (Chen & Lee, 2019).

2. **Detailed Information**: Nutritional information, allergen alerts, and ingredient lists are increasingly important to consumers (Martinez, 2021).

3. **Personalization**: The ability to customize orders increases customer satisfaction and loyalty (Williams et al., 2020).

4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: García and López (2022) found that 67% of campus food orders are placed on mobile devices, highlighting the importance of mobile-friendly design.

5. **Intuitive Navigation**: Menu categorization and search functionality significantly impact user experience and completion rates (Taylor, 2019).

6. **Performance Optimization**: Page load times directly correlate with abandonment rates, with optimal load times under 3 seconds (Google Research, 2021).

### 2.2 To design a Web based restaurant menu that meets the customer requirements, that is, a system that will display general information about Campus cafe

Design considerations for web-based restaurant systems have been extensively studied. Perkins (2021) proposed a user-centered design framework specifically for campus dining applications, emphasizing the importance of understanding the unique context of university dining, including time constraints between classes and diverse dietary needs.

Research by Davis & Thompson (2020) identified key information categories that customers expect from campus dining websites:
- Operating hours and location information
- Daily specials and promotions
- Nutritional information and allergen warnings
- Sustainability practices and sourcing information
- Payment options and meal plan integration

Hassan et al. (2021) conducted usability testing on various campus food ordering interfaces and found that simplified checkout processes with minimal steps had 30% higher completion rates. Their research also highlighted the importance of clear status indicators and confirmation messages in reducing user anxiety.

Design principles that have proven effective include:
- Clean, minimalist interface with intuitive navigation
- Consistent visual hierarchy and information architecture
- Clear call-to-action buttons and visual feedback
- Accessible design that accommodates diverse users
- Familiar patterns that align with users' mental models of e-commerce

### 2.3 To validate the Web based restaurant menu system developed during the course of the study

Validation approaches for web-based food service systems typically include both technical testing and user experience evaluation. Technical validation ensures functionality, performance, and security, while user experience validation assesses usability, satisfaction, and effectiveness in meeting user needs.

Brown & Morgan (2022) proposed a comprehensive testing framework for campus dining applications that includes:

1. **Functional Testing**: Ensuring all features work as intended across devices and browsers.

2. **Usability Testing**: Observing users completing common tasks to identify friction points.

3. **Performance Testing**: Measuring load times, responsiveness, and system behavior under various conditions.

4. **Accessibility Testing**: Ensuring the system is usable by people with disabilities.

5. **User Acceptance Testing**: Gathering feedback from actual users in realistic scenarios.

Rodriguez (2021) found that involving actual students and staff in the testing process was crucial for identifying campus-specific usability issues that might be missed in general testing. Their study recommended a phased rollout approach with iterative improvements based on user feedback.

Validation metrics commonly used include task completion rates, time-on-task, error rates, system usability scale (SUS) scores, and net promoter scores. Threshold values for these metrics should be established based on industry benchmarks and project-specific goals.
